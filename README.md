# hello-world
สวัสดีชาวโลก

I want to know how it will end

I want to be sure of what it will cost

I want the name of the ruiner

I want matches in case I have to suddenly burn

I want to know exactly what it's going to take

I want you to watch when I go down in flames

I want to reach my hand into the dark and feel what reaches back

I want you to know I know
